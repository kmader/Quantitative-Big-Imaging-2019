# Exercises
## General Information
The exercises are based on the lectures and take place in the same room after the lecture completes. Links to the exercises are provieded with the lecture slides in the [weekly schedule](weeklyschedule.md) The exercises are designed to offer a tiered level of understanding based on the background of the student. Most exercises are prepared as python notebooks that guides you step by step through the exercises. New python commands will be introduced when needed and links to the manual pages will be provided. This is not a course on python programming, you will learn to use this powerful language for different image processing tasks throughout the course. 



### Alternatives to using python
The is also the possiblity to use an open-source tool called KNIME (www.knime.org), with example workflows here (https://www.knime.org/example-workflows).  The basic exercises will require adding blocks in a workflow and adjusting parameters, while more advanced students will be able to write their own snippets, blocks or plugins to accomplish more complex tasks easily.
The exercises from two years ago (available [here](http://kmader.github.io/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2015/) are done entirely in ImageJ and Matlab for students who would prefer to stay in those environments (not recommended)

### Install Python

If you use colab, kaggle or mybinder you won't need python on your own machine but if you want to set it up in the same way the class has you can follow the instructions shown in the video [here](https://youtu.be/bnTCLLSpyf0) and below
1. Install Anaconda Python https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section
1. Download the course from github as a zip file
1. Extract the zip file
1. Open a terminal (or command prompt on windows)
1. Go to the binder folder inside the course directory (something like: `Downloads/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2019-master/binder`)
1. Install the environment
1. `conda env create -f environment.yml`
1. Activate the environment `conda activate qbi2019` or `activate qbi2019`
1. Go up one directory to the root of the course `cd ..`
1. Start python `jupyter notebook`

### Install KNIME

* Windows: https://www.dropbox.com/s/75hx7fdpnpzrh5u/knime_rsna_2018.zip?dl=0
* Mac: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3tdssp67daadzix/knime_rsna_mac.zip?dl=0
* (After you extract it move the KNIME.app into the /Applications/ folder)

## Assistance
The exercises will be supported by Stefano van Gogh and Anders Kaestner. There will be office hours in ETZ H75 on Thursdays between 14-15 or by appointment.

## Online Tools
The exercises will be available on Kaggle as 'Datasets' and we will be using mybinder as stated above.
